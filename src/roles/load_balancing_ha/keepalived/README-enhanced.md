      - "10.0.1.11"
    # Cloud virtual IP (configure in cloud console)
    virtual_ipaddresses:
      - ip: "{{ cloud_virtual_ip }}"
        cidr: 32
```

## Testing Instructions

The role includes comprehensive Molecule test scenarios:

### üß™ Basic Testing
```bash
cd src/roles/load_balancing_ha/keepalived
molecule test
```

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Mode Testing
```bash
molecule test -s unicast
```

### üîÑ Multi-Instance Testing
```bash
molecule test -s multi-instance
```

### üê≥ Container Testing
```bash
molecule test -s podman
```

### Test Coverage

Each scenario tests:
- ‚úÖ Package installation across distributions
- ‚úÖ Configuration generation and validation
- ‚úÖ Service management and startup
- ‚úÖ Feature-specific functionality
- ‚úÖ Backward compatibility
- ‚úÖ Error handling and edge cases

## Known Issues and Gotchas

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Environments
- **Multicast Limitation**: Cloud providers block multicast traffic. Always use `unicast_src_ip` and `unicast_peers`.
- **Virtual IP Management**: In cloud environments, configure the VIP in the provider's console rather than letting keepalived assign it.
- **Security Groups**: Ensure VRRP traffic (protocol 112) is allowed between instances.

### üåê Network Configuration
- **Firewall Rules**: VRRP uses IP protocol 112. Ensure it's allowed between cluster members.
- **Split-brain Prevention**: Implement proper network monitoring to prevent split-brain scenarios.
- **Interface Names**: Cloud instances may have different interface names (`ens3`, `eth0`, etc.). Use `ansible_default_ipv4.interface`.

### üîí Authentication Considerations
- **AH Authentication**: Requires IPSec kernel modules. May not work in containers.
- **Password Security**: PASS authentication transmits passwords in clear text.
- **Key Management**: Store authentication keys in Ansible Vault.

### üì¶ Container Environments
- **Privileged Mode**: Containers need `NET_ADMIN` and `NET_RAW` capabilities.
- **Network Mode**: Use host networking or custom networks with proper routing.

## Security Implications

### üîê Authentication Security
- **PASS Mode**: Clear-text transmission. Use only on trusted networks.
- **AH Mode**: Cryptographic authentication with IPSec. Recommended for production.
- **No Authentication**: Only for completely isolated environments.

### üìú Script Security
- **Root Execution**: Custom scripts run as root. Audit all script content.
- **File Permissions**: The role sets secure permissions but review custom scripts.
- **Input Validation**: Ensure scripts handle edge cases safely.

### üåê Network Security
- **VRRP Traffic**: Secure against rogue VRRP advertisements.
- **SNMP Access**: If enabled, configure SNMP security properly.
- **Log Security**: Protect log files containing potentially sensitive information.

### üîë Secrets Management
```yaml
# Use Ansible Vault for sensitive data
keepalived_auth_pass: "{{ vault_keepalived_password }}"
slack_webhook_url: "{{ vault_slack_webhook }}"
```
